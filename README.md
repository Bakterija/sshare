### The primary goal of this project was to try and learn some more html, css, javascript, python flask    
    
### sshare is a flask webapp that has
 - Simple authentication
 - File uploading for authenticated users
 - Anonymous file downloading
 - A w3 theme that works ok on mobile devices
 - Autogenerated random hyperlinks for uploaded files similiar to sharing files in nextcloud, dropbox, others
 - CSS, javascript scripts, utils that will be useful in other projects

### Default user is "admin" with password "111"

### Other information
 - Any user can add and remove any other user (I am the only user right now and don't have any need to add a more complex system)
 - Config file and uploaded files are stored in $USER_HOME%/.config/github_bakterija/ss_share/ on linux and $USER_HOME%/github_bakterija/ss_share/ on others
